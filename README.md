# TISB-hackathon-2024
Only works on android
just install the APK
to properly look throught the files and how the project was made you'll need to open it in Unity 2021.3.24f1 though you can open the scripts in Microsoft VS or some other text editor if you just want the C# scripts
This Repo includes an APK file to run it on Android, A video for showcase, The source code, and an extra surprise in this readme(please check it out before actually playing)
Here's the link for the surprise https://www.mediafire.com/file/l547rtnafdn3hd9/Lore.html/file install and run the html file
